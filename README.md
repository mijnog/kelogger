# Kellogger

![Kellog's Original Cornflakes Logo](media_1b2558f258e08fff37b0b39d9929ad254e4702571.png)

Works on linux. On my Ubuntu keyboard input file is `/dev/input/event7`. This may be different on your system.

Since this keylogger runs as a daemon you won't see errors on stderr. On Ubuntu, you can use `journalctl -t kellogger` to find error messages, or `journalctl -t kellogger -f` to see them appear in real time.

#### Usage

First run `make`, then just run `./kellogger` as root or `./kellogger <path-to-event-file>`.

Key logs are stored in `/tmp/kellogs.txt`

#### Future features 
-> Beaconing to C&C Server.
-> Persistence and Stealth
